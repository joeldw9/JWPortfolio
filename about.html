            <div class="aboutMe">
                <p>I was born on March 25, 2004, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. I lived there for 14 years until moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where I attended Conestoga Valley High School. For my senior year, instead of doing more high school classes, I decided to further my education by doing college courses. I applied to TSCT, and was accepted as an early enroller.</p>
                <p>I have had a main focus on technology for years, starting as a toddler. I recieved an iPod Touch for Christmas in 2009, and ever since, technology has been a main aspect of my life. I started out by playing educational games on the device, and eventually began to learn more about coding when I decided to jailbreak it. I began trying to develop games, but did not have the knowledge or time to do so at the time.</p>
                <p> Around the start of seventh grade, I finally had the time and money to truly start working with software. I bought my first computer for Christmas around 2015, and began coding small projects, mostly through block code websites such as Scratch. In 2018, when I moved to Lancaster, I began learning more and more. I took a computer science course in my ninth grade year, and learned how to use basic functions in Python and C++.</p>
                <p>Once I enrolled in Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, I started to work more and more with true programming. Classes started with learning Node.JS, and eventually included CSS and HTML, which is where I am now. Throughout my time so far this semester, I have learned much more about the ideas behind software and development teams, and I am continuing to learn more about it daily.</p>
